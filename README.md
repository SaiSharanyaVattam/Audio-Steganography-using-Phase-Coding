# Audio-Steganography-using-Phase-Coding
Audio steganography involves concealing a secret message within an audio file, known as 
the carrier audio, by manipulating the audio signal. This technique takes advantage of the 
limitations of the human auditory system, exploiting the challenge in distinguishing 
between low and loud sounds, where a louder sound can potentially overshadow a softer 
one.
The phase coding method operates by replacing the phase of an initial audio segment 
with a reference phase that corresponds to the data. The phase of subsequent segments 
is adjusted to maintain the relative phase between segments. In terms of the signal-to- 
perceived noise ratio, phase coding is among the most effective coding techniques.
